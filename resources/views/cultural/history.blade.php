            The canoe was probably the most essential object of Polynesian culture, because without it there would have
            been no island populations as we know them today. Little is known about the nature, shape and construction
            of the boats that allowed migrants to travel across the Pacific. By means of scientific voyages, we can
            therefore only assume that the ancients sailed like their descendants, on double or outrigger canoes (thanks
            to winds, swells and stars). On the other hand, from the discovery of the Polynesian islands in the second
            half of the eighteenth
            century, the Europeans can give the first descriptions of the patterns they observe. All of these travelers
            are
            struck by the important role played by the canoe in the daily life of these Pacific peoples.

        <p class="mb-4">
            An essential tool for fishing, an imperative means of transport between the islands or a war engine, these
            boats made with Stone Age means are remarkable for their construction principles and nautical qualities.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Ancient canoes can be classified according to their design and mode of propulsion: double canoes with
            paddles or sails and outrigger canoes with paddles or sails.

            <li>
                The small single pirogue with outrigger and paddle, "vaa", from 5 to 9 meters, is used for short trips
                and coastal fishing. The hull is carved out of a single tree trunk (like the tamanu) and the outrigger
                is on the left.
            </li>
            <li>
                The outrigger and sailing canoe, "vaa motu", from 10 to 13 meters, is used for fishing and short trips.
                The hull is worked from one or two trunks and at least one row of planks is tied over the flat edges.
                The front crossbar of the arm supports a narrow platform allowing a man to act as a counterweight if
                necessary. The type of sail is different depending on the archipelago.
            </li>
            <li>
                The double sailing canoe, "tipairua" for transport and "pahi" for travel. It can grow up to 25 metres
                long. With one or two sails, this "catamaran" is manoeuvred by 4 to 20 men depending on its size. It is
                the type of canoe with which great voyages of discovery are considered possible. About sixty passengers
                and their provisions could be placed on board.
            </li>
            <li>
                The double canoe with paddle. Apart from the "tira" for fishing, only war canoes can be found in this
                category. The "pahi tamai" is divided into two classes: the round-bottomed one intended only for war,
                and others with a V-shaped background that can be used either for war or for travel.
            </li>
        </ul>
